Modlist Designed with Modern ACT features and gameplay with Multiplayer (E.G. Skyrim Together) In mind

## Some History

When I first discovered the mod Skyrim Together back around 2019, the idea of cooperative play in Skyrim immediately captured my attention. I thought, “What if there were a modpack that could bring the thrill of modern combat and gameplay enhancements while staying compatible with co-op?” This question launched a task spanning nearly six years, with by countless tests, tweaks, and a lot of procrastination. The result is *Elden Rim Together*: a carefully fintuned modlist that combines single-player and multiplayer experiences with updated combat and gameplay, built for those who crave a fresh take on cooperative Skyrim
